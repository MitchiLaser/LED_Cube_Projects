# Blinking LED-Cube

This is an ancient sketch for an 4x4x4 LED-Cube with single colored LEDs. The only purpose of this cube is to blink randomly. The Sketch can run an an Attiny 13 A. In this special case the code has been precompiled for the Attiny 13 A. Therefore you don't have to install several toolchains and plugins for the Arduino IDE to bring it uopn your own Attiny 13 A if you want to rebuild this whole thing.
